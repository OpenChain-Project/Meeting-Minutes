# Export Control Workgroup Meeting 2023-08-01

## Update on Work

### Pull Requests

Several pull requests were merged just before the call.
* PR 17 - Steve added a version of the Sources file to the repo, as Markdown.
* PR 18 - Steve extended the CONTRIBUTING.md file.

### New Issues

* There is now a version of the sources file. This lists the reference sources used in collecting
    the original material. However, it consists of several links, which are now dead. So new links
    need to be located.
* We proposed an initial, small group of country files to review, for formatting and typo purposes only -
    not for making substantative changes to their content.

### Checklist

Steve pointed to a [checklist from the US Government](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-15/subtitle-B/chapter-VII/subchapter-C/part-742/appendix-Supplement%20No.%206%20to%20Part%20742)
which may be helpful in identifying things that could be considered attributes or metadata for the individual country files.

## OpenChain Mini-Summit

Steve noted that, with the two-month cadence of the group, the next call will occur after the LF Open Source Summit Europe
will have taken place, at which an OpenChain Mini-Summit is scheduled. Shane noted that the Mini-Summit was likely to be
rescheduled to later in the event week, as it clashed with the SPDX day, and the attendee overlap is significant.
